# Solve Quadratics

## Write a program that solves the quadratic

## An example of what it should do is below

I can solve ax^2 + bx + c = 0 for you!

Please give me the 'a' coefficient: ***0***

Please give me the 'b' coefficient: ***1***

Please give me the 'c' coefficient: ***1***

Sorry, but 'a' cannot be zero.

Please give me the 'a' coefficient: ***1***

Please give me the 'b' coefficient: ***2***

Please give me the 'c' coefficient: ***3***

Sorry, but that quadratic does not have real roots.

Please give me the 'a' coefficient: ***1***

Please give me the 'b' coefficient: ***two 2 bla bla bla***

That is not real number!

Please give me the 'a' coefficient: ***1.5***

Please give me the 'b' coefficient: ***2.6***

Please give me the 'c' coefficient: ***-3.1***

Thank you, that is a valid input :) OKAY I'LL SOLVE IT NOW.
